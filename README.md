# EB_Model

The goal of this lab is to learn collectively how to use github as a resource to co-develop science. We will use existing code from an energy balance model developed in MatLab, and translate it into python.

The model is divided into a series of submodels, or components of the energy balance.

Each student will be responsible for a component of the Energy Balance, and then making the translation to python. Then we will design a master EB model that runs all of the other sub-routines.

We will start with an existing dataset from the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest, but each of you will be responsible getting a dataset of your own and running the model.
