## Sub-routines in python

So far you have run code as a series of sequential operations. But what happens if you need to combine a series of operations, each of which operates independently of each other, but that connect back at some later point in time. 

Sub-routines help you do just that - organize coe in a series of smaller chunks that then link back togther. For example in the figure below, a series of operations is performed and the looped in for a distinct calculation (add or subtract), and then incorporated back into the main program.

We are going to do the same thing with the energy balance. You will each work on a subroutine that represents a sub-component of the energy balance. You will then bring them back together to create a single snow EB model.
